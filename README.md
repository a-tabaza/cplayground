# cplayground
This year I realized I was working on something, and GitHub Copilot was acting up, and I started to get frustrated, I was just staring at the new empty line like a dum dum waiting for the autocomplete to load.

So in the name of polar extremes, this year will be the year of git using the terminal (I used it through vscode before), nano instead of vscode, and from scratch implementations of the shit I used to do in python using C.

I will either emerge from this venture vowing to never touch software again, or I'll finally feel comfortable calling myself an "engineer"

# rules
	- No autocomplete, no LSP, only _n a n o_.
	- man for documentation whenever possible, official docs online are allowed for emergencies.
	- chatgpt and other derivates are strictly prohibited unless I'm doing something in prod in python, my "mother tongue".
	- the most minimal of dependencies ever, if I need a parser, I'll use someone else's, data structures, I'll try writing them myself, but going off of a reference implementation.

# motivation
Turns out it's possible to enjoy programming. Ik it's hard to believe but you check it out on YouTube, some people actually enjoy this! Blasphemous, but leaves much to ponder about.
